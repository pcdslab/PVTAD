## Prerequisites
Required packages can be installed on python3.6 environment.
### Installing Libraries & Dependencies
```
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tfimm
pip install timm
pip install opencv-python
```
### Data
In this research, we used T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sMRI scans from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (https://adni.loni.usc.edu/). 

## Train & Test
All models including ResNet-18, standard ViT(Tiny), Pyramid ViT (Tiny), and parallel ResNet-18 & standard ViT(Tiny) were implemented in PVTAD_Project.ipynb <br><br> Run PVTAD_Project.ipynb
